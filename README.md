## Introduction
At the third day of learning Vue, I made a quiz app without following any tutorial. To see my capabilities in that three days, I decided to do build a project myself hereby everything including the design made based on my knowledge. For the design part, I've applied mobile-first technique.

I have used [Vuex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex) to share data between components and [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/) to get quiz questions.
